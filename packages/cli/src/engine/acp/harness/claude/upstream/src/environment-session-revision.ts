/**
 * Identify the latest main-conversation message in a session's transcript under
 * `environment` that the session's own query did not write, or return an empty
 * string when there is none.
 *
 * Claude Code chains each new message to the last one its process holds in memory,
 * so a new message from another client means this query continues an earlier copy.
 * The query's own messages are excluded because the CLI may flush them after the
 * turn completes. Background task notifications are excluded too: the Claude process
 * that ran the task appends them on its own, without a prompt from any client.
 * Metadata such as titles and prompt pointers is not conversation.
