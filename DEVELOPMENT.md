# Development Guide

## Local Execution Boundary

Mobius connects remote clients to agent harnesses running on a user's machine. The process that performs a local side effect is therefore the final and only trusted enforcement point.

Every operation that can affect the local machine must follow the same pipeline:

```text
untrusted input
  -> schema validation
  -> normalization and target resolution
  -> capability and target authorization
  -> execution
  -> audit event
```

Keep validation and authorization distinct. Schema validation establishes that a request is well formed; authorization establishes that the active session may perform that specific operation. Neither result implies the other.

For values whose meaning can change after resolution, check both forms. Examples include symbolic links, relative paths, redirects, hostnames, executable lookup, and command arguments. Authorization must be repeated at the local execution boundary immediately before the side effect.

## Make Illegal States Unrepresentable

Use a discriminated union when behavior or available data depends on a lifecycle or protocol state:

```ts
type SessionState =
  | { readonly kind: "connecting" }
  | {
      readonly kind: "active";
      readonly sessionId: string;
      readonly capabilities: ReadonlySet<Capability>;
    }
  | { readonly kind: "closed"; readonly reason: CloseReason };
```

Do not model the same concept as unrelated optional fields:

```ts
// Invalid combinations are possible: active without a session ID, or closed with capabilities.
interface SessionState {
  readonly active?: boolean;
  readonly sessionId?: string;
  readonly capabilities?: ReadonlySet<Capability>;
  readonly closeReason?: CloseReason;
}
```

State transitions should accept only valid source states and return a complete destination state. Consumers must use exhaustive branching without a permissive `default` branch. Use an `assertNever` helper when the control flow does not otherwise prove exhaustiveness.

Use optional properties only when absence is meaningful within the same state. Use `null` only when an explicit empty value is part of the domain. Reserve `Partial<T>` for update payloads, never for lifecycle or protocol states.

## Protocol, Domain, and Port Contracts

Treat protocol messages, domain values, and ports as contracts. Their properties must be `readonly` so consumers cannot mutate shared state behind the owner's back.

Declare callbacks and port operations with function property syntax:

```ts
interface HarnessPort {
  readonly connect: (
    request: ConnectRequest,
    signal: AbortSignal,
  ) => Promise<Session>;
}
```

Do not use method syntax for these contracts. TypeScript intentionally excludes method parameter positions from `strictFunctionTypes`, while function properties receive the stricter variance check.

This rule applies to protocol, domain, and port contracts. It does not require every short-lived local object or mutable implementation detail to be immutable.

## Abstraction Discipline

Start with the simplest direct implementation of the current behavior. Keep control flow local and linear when that makes the operation easier to read.

Introduce an abstraction only when at least one of these conditions is true:

- It isolates a real external boundary, such as a transport, harness, clock, or persistent store.
- A second real use case requires interchangeable behavior.
- Current duplication has been demonstrated and the abstraction makes the code simpler.

Do not create layers, factories, generic frameworks, configuration switches, or extension points for hypothetical future requirements. Remove unused indirection. Extract details when they obscure the caller's main control flow, but keep them inline when they are the function's primary job.
